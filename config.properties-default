#This is the config for goslink.  You need to set a few settings
#to make it work.  Remember don't include "'s unless you proceed
#them with a \.  So if you want 'blah "blah" blah' as string do
#'blah \"blah\" blah'.  Or you will break lots of things.
#
#You need to disable ansi on the accounts for goslink.  Or it 
#won't see a lot of strings.
